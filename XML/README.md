# XML Typesetting

Typesetting in XML is an essential part of journal article production. XML formatted according to the journal article tag suite used by the [NLM](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/) ensures that the article can be rendered for online display. It is a [requirement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/guidelines/#techqual) to provide XML for inclusing in PMC.

Typesetting in JATS XML is facilitated using Texture, a free open source XML editor.
